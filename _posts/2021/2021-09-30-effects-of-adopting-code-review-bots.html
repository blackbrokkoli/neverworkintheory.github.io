<div class="review">
  <p>
    Several years ago,
    I grumbled that software tooling had basically stalled in the 1980sâ€”that
    everything I used to write code today would have been familiar to my younger self.
    <a href="https://www.margaretstorey.com/">Prof. Peggy Storey</a> corrected me,
    pointing out that social coding tools like Stack Overflow and Slack bots
    had changed programming every bit as much as linters and interactive debuggers.
  </p>
  <p>
    <cite>Wessel2020</cite> is a good look at what happens when a team adopts one of those tools:
    a bot that automatically runs code checks on pull requests
    and sends the results back to the PR's author.
    They found that adopting a code review bot:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      increases the number of monthly merged pull requests,
    </li>
    <li>
      decreases monthly non-merged pull requests, but
    </li>
    <li>
      decreases communication among developers.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Looking at the third result more closely,
    the authors find that the amount of communication <em>as comments on the PR</em> decreases.
    This seems to be because the number of comments depends on how long the PR is open;
    since adopting a code review bot leads to PRs being merged more quickly,
    it's not surprising that the number of comments would go down.
    In addition,
    the authors weren't able to look at out-of-band communication
    (e.g., via email or messaging),
    so the simple statement that communication decreases should be unpacked before it's shared.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Software bots, which are widely adopted by Open Source Software (OSS)
  projects, support developers on several activities, including code
  review. However, as with any new technology adoption, bots may impact group
  dynamics. Since understanding and anticipating such effects is important for
  planning and management, we investigate how several activity indicators change
  after the adoption of a code review bot. We employed a regression
  discontinuity design on 1,194 software projects from GitHub. Our results
  indicate that the adoption of code review bots increases the number of monthly
  merged pull requests, decreases monthly non-merged pull requests, and
  decreases communication among developers. Practitioners and maintainers may
  leverage our results to understand, or even predict, bot effects on their
  projects' social interactions.
