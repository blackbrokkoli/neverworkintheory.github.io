    This paper from Zhu and Godfrey looks at single-statement bug fixes in Java
    code: more specifically, at the differences between how bug are fixed by the
    people who created them and how they are fixed by other people. The authors
    found that people fix their own bugs more quickly than other people's, which
    falls under the heading of "I would have predicted that, but it's nice to
    have it validated".
  </p>
  <p>
    What I <em>wouldn't</em> have predicted is that when people fix their own
    bugs, they tend to create larger commits that also address other issues;
    when they fix other people's bugs, their commits are smaller and more
    tightly focused.  It's easy to say that this could have been predicted as
    well, but its opposite would have been just as plausible after the fact: if
    the authors had found that people are <em>more</em> focused when fixing
    their own small bugs, I would also have said, "Yeah, that makes sense." This
    is why I find empirical studies so valuable: in many cases "X" and "not X"
    are equally easy to rationalize, so we need evidence to help us decide which
    to believe.

    Two more things to note about this paper. First, it relies on the SZZ
    algorithm to align bugs and code fixes, so the results discussed above
    depend on how well that algorithm does its job; a future post will dive into
    that. Second, the dataset used in this paper is
    <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/manysstubs4j">available
    online</a> at <a href="https://paperswithcode.com">paperswithcode.com</a> so
    that other people (like you) can explore it, reanalyze it, or use it in
    courses. The frequency with which researchers make data available like this
    is one of the biggest and most welcome changes in research during our
    four-year hiatus (the other being the trend toward open access
    publishing). We will try to link to datasets whenever we can; if we miss
    any, please <a href="mailto:{{site.author.email}}">contact us</a>,

  In this work, we study how the authorship of code affects bug-fixing commits
  using the SStuBs dataset, a collection of single-statement bug fix changes in
  popular Java Maven projects. More specifically, we study the differences in
  characteristics between simple bug fixes by the original author—that is, the
  developer who submitted the bug-inducing commit—and by different developers
  (i.e., non-authors). Our study shows that nearly half (i.e., 44.3%) of simple
  bugs are fixed by a different developer. We found that bug fixes by the
  original author and by different developers differed qualitatively and
  quantitatively. We observed that bug-fixing time by authors is much shorter
  than that of other developers. We also found that bug-fixing commits by
  authors tended to be larger in size and scope, and address multiple issues,
  whereas bug-fixing commits by other developers tended to be smaller and more
  focused on the bug itself. Future research can further study the different
  patterns in bug-fixing and create more tailored tools based on the developer's
  needs.
