    Searching online serves as a base to solve problems and has become
    an inseparable part of our regular life. Developers in the
    software industry also rely on extracting relevant information
    from Google and other search engines to maximize their
    efficiency. A comprehensive illustration of the web-search queries
    from the perspective of software developers is provided
    in <cite>Hora2021a</cite>.  By analyzing 1.3M search queries from
    developers, the authors found that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Almost half of the queries (54.5%) from the developer’s 
      end refer to programming languages and software technologies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Queries are short and are mostly focused on searching APIs 
      and for code examples that can be reused.
    </li>
    <li>
      Over 80% of the queries are formed of nouns, adjectives,
      adverbs, and verbs; developers possibly believe that function
      words such as prepositions and conjunctions won’t affect the
      search results.
    </li>
    <li>
      60% of the queries have at least one other similar query.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stack Overflow is the most popular source for software resources 
      followed by YouTube and W3Schools.
    </li>
    <li>
      The order of the search results are likely to change due to
      minor query change such as swapping the position of words,
      removing a word, or using synonyms.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Studies like this help deepen our understanding of the software
    developers's requirements, and also highlight the tremendous
    impact on development of popular search engines like Google whose
    algorithms are opaque and out of our control.
    <cite>Hora2021a</cite> also found that developers prefer short
    straightforward queries and ignore function words.  The creators
    of packages and applications should take this into account when
    creating documentation or answering questions in online forums in
    order to help developers find answers more quickly and more
    accurately.

  Developers often search for software resources on the web.  In
  practice, instead of going directly to websites (e.g., Stack
  Overflow), they rely on search engines (e.g., Google).  Despite this
  being a common activity, we are not yet aware of what developers
  search from the perspective of popular software development websites
  and what search results are returned.  With this knowledge, we can
  understand real-world queries, developers’ needs, and the query
  impact on the search results.  In this paper, we provide an
  empirical study to understand what developers search on the web and
  what they find. We assess 1.3M queries to popular programming
  websites and we perform thousands of queries on Google to explore
  search results. We find that (i) developers’ queries typically start
  with keywords (e.g., Python, Android, etc.), are short (3 words),
  tend to omit functional words, and are similar among each other;
  (ii) minor changes to queries do not largely affect the Google
  search results, however, some cosmetic changes may have a
  non-negligible impact; and (iii) search results are dominated by
  Stack Overflow, but YouTube is also a relevant source nowadays. We
  conclude by presenting detailed implications for researchers and
  developers.
