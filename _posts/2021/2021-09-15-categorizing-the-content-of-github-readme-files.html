    Astronomers have to analyze the optical properties of the glass in their telescopes
    in order to correct for things like chromatic aberration.
    Equally,
    software engineering researchers need to study and validate
    the tools they build to collect and classify data
    in order to know how reliable those tools are.
  </p>
  <p>
    <cite>Prana2018</cite> is a good example of this.
    Its authors built a classifier
    to label the sections in the README files found in GitHub repositories as
    What, Why, How, When, Who, References, Contribution, or Other.
    They then evaluated the classifier numerically
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score">F-score</a> of 0.746)
    and by having twenty programmers check whether the classification helped them find information.
    Along the way they find that information discussing the What and How of repositories is very common,
    but many README files don't talk about the purpose and status of the repository.
    No one is going to start a billion-dollar business based on the result,
    but it is careful, patient work like this
    that builds a foundation for other researchers to stand on.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  README files play an essential role in shaping a developer's first
  impression of a software repository and in documenting the software
  project that the repository hosts. Yet, we lack a systematic
  understanding of the content of a typical README file as well as
  tools that can process these files automatically. To close this gap,
  we conduct a qualitative study involving the manual annotation of
  4,226 README file sections from 393 randomly sampled GitHub
  repositories and we design and evaluate a classifier and a set of
  features that can categorize these sections automatically. We find
  that information discussing the 'What' and 'How' of a repository is
  very common, while many README files lack information regarding the
  purpose and status of a repository. Our multi-label classifier which
  can predict eight different categories achieves an F1 score of
  0.746. To evaluate the usefulness of the classification, we used the
  automatically determined classes to label sections in GitHub README
  files using badges and showed files with and without these badges to
  twenty software professionals. The majority of participants
  perceived the automated labeling of sections based on our classifier
  to ease information discovery. This work enables the owners of
  software repositories to improve the quality of their documentation
  and it has the potential to make it easier for the software
  development community to discover relevant information in GitHub
  README files.
