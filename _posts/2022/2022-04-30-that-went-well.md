Our [first online event]({{ '/events/' | relative_url }}) on April 27 is now over,
and from all the feedback we've received it went very well.
There were the inevitable technical hitches—some people couldn't sign in to the discussion forum
to ask questions,
video conferencing locked up for a few minutes during one speaker's presentation—but
those were pretty minor
when set against the engaging and informative presentations.

Thank you again to all the presenters,
to Taylor & Francis and Strange Loop for their sponsorship,
and to Mozilla for providing technical support.
We hope to have recordings of the presentations online in the next couple of weeks (if not sooner),
and please stay tuned for news about our next event.
