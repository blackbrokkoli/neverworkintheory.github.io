    <cite>[Nakajo1991]</cite> analyzes ~700 software errors in 4 commercial measuring-control products and utilizes a restricted version of fault tree analysis (FTA) to capture meaningful cause-effect failure patterns. It also discusses the effectiveness of Structured Analysis and Structured Design (SA/SD) methods on repressing the identified error mechanisms.

  <p>
    The study observes failures at chosen points along its “cause-effect process of software errors” (chosen points in bold):
    <ol>
      <li>inappropriate management of work system</li>
      <li>work system flaw (<b>process</b>, individual, environmental flaws)</li>
      <li><b>human error</b></li>
      <li><b>program fault</b></li>
      <li>system failure</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    The methodology provides a systematic mapping of software failures to their ultimate cause and leverages statistical analysis to draw conclusions about rates of particular errors across projects. However, it is limited in the types of software it analyzes (2 system products and 2 firmware products) and was not able to study certain paths along its own defined error cause-effect process (namely individual and environmental flaws).

    <cite>[Nakajo1991]</cite> concluded that:
    <li>Two major error patterns resulted from hardware or software interface misunderstandings.</li>
    <li>Two more common error sources emerged from system and module function misconceptions.</li>
    <li>SA/SD efforts to mitigate these failures were effective on the first two but not the last two error-occurrence sources.</li>

  Approximately 700 errors in four commercial measuring-control software products were analyzed, and the cause-effect relationships of errors occurring during software development were identified. The analysis method used defined appropriate observation points along the path leading from cause to effect of a software error and gathered the corresponding data by analyzing each error using fault tree analysis. Each observation point's data were categorized, and the relationships between two adjoining points were summarized using a cross-indexing table. Four major error-occurrence mechanisms were identified; two are related to hardware and software interface specification misunderstandings, while the other two are related to system and module function misunderstandings. The effects of structured analysis and structured design methods on software errors were evaluated.< >
