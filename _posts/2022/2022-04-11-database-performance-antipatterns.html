  Database-access performance antipatterns in database-backed web applications.

    Database-backed web applications are prone to performance bugs related to database accesses. While much work has been conducted on database-access antipatterns with some recent work focusing on performance impact, there still lacks a comprehensive view of database-access performance antipatterns in database-backed web applications. To date, no existing work systematically reports known antipatterns in the literature, and no existing work has studied database-access performance bugs in major types of web applications that access databases differently.To address this issue, we first summarize all known database-access performance antipatterns found through our literature survey, and we report all of them in this paper. We further collect database-access performance bugs from web applications that access databases through language-provided SQL interfaces, which have been largely ignored by recent work, to check how extensively the known antipatterns can cover these bugs. For bugs not covered by the known antipatterns, we extract new database-access performance antipatterns based on real-world performance bugs from such web applications. Our study in total reports 24 known and 10 new database-access performance antipatterns. Our results can guide future work to develop effective tool support for different types of web applications.
