    Thanks to their flexibility and intuitive programming model,
    spreadsheets are widely used in industry, often for
    business-critical applications. Similar to software developers,
    professional spreadsheet users demand support for maintaining and
    transferring their spreadsheets.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this paper, we first study the problems and information needs
    of professional spreadsheet users by means of a survey conducted
    at a large financial company. Based on these needs, we then
    present an approach that extracts this information from
    spreadsheets and presents it in a compact and easy to understand
    way, using leveled dataflow diagrams. Our approach comes with
    three different views on the dataflow and allows the user to
    analyze the dataflow diagrams in a top-down fashion also using
    slicing techniques.
  </p>
  <p>
    To evaluate the usefulness of the proposed approach, we conducted
    a series of interviews as well as nine case studies in an
    industrial setting. The results of the evaluation clearly indicate
    the demand for and usefulness of our approach in ease the
    understanding of spreadsheets.

    Many professional software developers might cringe when thinking
    about spreadsheets, or simply not take them seriously because
    they're not "real programming". They are, however, a fact of
    business and often get the job done. While they can be developed
    much faster, they also bear a great potential for errors. Felienne
    and her co-authors embraced this reality and decided to do
    something about it—using approaches from software engineering.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ignoring any assumptions regarding the problems of spreadsheet
    users, they used Grounded Theory in an industry setting to find
    out which problems really existed in business. One thing they
    found was that existing spreadsheets often need to be understood
    by new users. Diving deeper, they found that the comprehensibility
    of such inherited spreadsheets was often seriously lacking—posing
    a great risk from a business perspective.
  </p>
  <p>
    The authors then developed a tool to help with this issue. It
    creates dataflow diagrams that make dependencies in spreadsheet
    formulas visible. An evaluation with business users showed that
    these diagrams are indeed comprehensible and useful—that is, they
    help end-users in understanding unfamiliar spreadsheets. Another
    interesting finding was that the creators of—in their view—simple
    spreadsheets only realized the actual complexity of their own
    creations after having used the tool.
  </p>
  <p>
    The best part is: Felienne, Martin, and Arie demonstrated the
    practical relevance again by
    launching <a href="http://infotron.nl/">a successful startup based
    on this research</a>! The company is now part of the Dutch startup
    incubator "YesDelft", has partnerships with several IT service
    companies, and has paying customers. How's that for practical
    relevance of research?
