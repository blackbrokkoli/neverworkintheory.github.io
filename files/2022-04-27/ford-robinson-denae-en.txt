hi everyone thank you so much for inviting me here today it's a pleasure to speak to you all um i'm danae ford robinson a researcher at the intersection of online community software engineering and human computer interaction and today i guess my talk takes a little bit of a different twist from what others have been talking about i'm going to be really consolidating some findings from prior research of other amazing scholars and researchers looking into safety um so i want to take this time to talk about how we can keep developers safe drawing on their work and in this talk i'll be sharing findings from their research and in the hope that we can help to devise interventions that can better support the developer community and really understand how we can keep people safe and the community safe at scale safety is something that many of us often take for granted unfortunately it isn't until we're on the other side of an uncomfortable or unsettling situation that we begin to think of why it is important to have processes or tools in place to keep us protected so this article that i have shared on the screen here is from the atlantic really highlighted that in a series of studies of online engagement they were really finding in diving deeper into how this small number of people can often silence the dominating view or the silent few in online forums so thinking back to some of the work that's already been presented today from kelly blinko and others about how that criticism how that harassment can really be discouraging to folks um sometimes it's easier to do this in certain settings likewise a pew research center study conducted in 2017 found that four in 10 americans have experienced some form of harassment online so this type of harassment i'm describing includes name calling doxxing stalking or really just spamming right being disrespectful not being as welcoming these types of online harassments can especially damn can be especially damaging for open source communities um the maintainers and marginalized people specifically as it makes it difficult for them to productively participate in these online spaces especially when working publicly so when we translate this activity to open source we really have to think about how this can impact the people who build systems in the public eye so some of the ones i've previously investigated were centered around open source software for social good so the projects i have on the screen uh are kind of really centered around how people are building tools developers are building tools to support a broad societal good to help a specific population so the one on the left here is little window which is centered around supporting uh victims of intimate partner violence and the one on the right is refuge restrooms which helps non-binary genderqueer and intersex folks find safe restrooms developers and contributors who work on these types of projects can have quite polarizing views uh and the people who are observing and using this project can see that there have been quite polarizing political perspectives and thus are at risk and like many other socio-technical forums these conversations around these projects can get heated and sometimes sing to the next level and even often times out of out of context to become quite harmful

so this is where psychological safety really matters so for developers feeling unsafe can directly impact your quality of work um and thus the quality systems and tools that you build so a survey from the global wellness institute reported that 62 of u.s workers found that when workers felt immensely unwell it significantly impacted their work performance and how they seen their growth overall safety ultimately provides a level of confidence that makes you feel more comfortable engaging so i like to think of safety in relation to going outside and below freezing weather so you could still go outside as you are in a t-shirt or shorts but with a jacket or a blanket around you you feel a bit more protected from the elements while you're out there so you can still contribute to open source and engage in the broader developer community but with safety precautions and safety mechanisms you know you can feel a bit more protected in that journey so the question i really have here i want to post the community into our broader developer community here is how do we recreate the safety and assurance in online programming communities because if you don't feel safe and supported then honestly why would you engage so long story short when it comes to products safety is the minimum and it's important that developers feel like they are psychologically safe without feeling safe again you cannot be effective and the quality of your work that you need to produce what i also have on the screen there at the bottom is a report from stuart geiger's report of the 2017 github survey where they talk a lot about some of the approaches people have used to kind of circumvent or resolve some of their harassment and unwelcoming experiences that they've they have experienced on the platform um i'm hoping that throughout this talk i'll kind of be giving a couple nuggets from prior empirical research that can inspire some ongoing work that you as the developer community can start building on as well

so when we try to answer this question for the developer community it's extremely important that we leverage prior studies that have been investigating this in other settings so there's been several studies that look at what collective action looks like for community members to feel safe and protected so i draw on a lot of scholars from a broader computer supported cooperative work systems and forums like amy zhang who has worked on this tool called squad box which is really geared at trying to support people who have faced harassment and allowing them to collectively grab the group of peers to contribute to support others another one i highlight here on the slide is i heart mob which is again a community dedicated to offering support of the victims of harassment so again collectively gathering your peers your colleagues as well to come up with your own system to feel victims feel supported help people feel supported and thus encourage them engaging so again the wrong question here i have is how do we what does it look like for developers trying to engage in communities and when i do that i also want to highlight what has been quite successful so i want to call out things on the slide here which are from github's community safety team um so for those of you in the audience may be familiar with folks this was a previous team like at github other members of the team include lexi galentino danielle young caroline ada mckay february keaney a slew of others i mean they've been tasked with building tools to figure out how to keep people safe on these platforms so one of them is this temporary interaction limits where you can caution or give people or encourage people to take a beat when they may be spamming issues as well as thinking about different reporting mechanisms that can report to the admins or the maintainers of the organization versus what content may be more appropriate to share to the github support overall so thinking about seeing these successful features that have been built on infrastructure or in situ in the platform but think about what we can do broadly at a level of different scale within each organization is what i want us to charge to look at so the code of conduct research there's been significant code of conduct research and developer settings as well as in research academic research settings looking at how we can encourage folks to engage so on the slide here i have the python code of conduct as well as the contributor covenant which has been really successful at adopting folks have been adopting some of these wishes and these guidelines for how people should engage but there's also been not as much of a growth in these areas as we would have hoped to see um so renee lee and hannah fuklodge and laura davis had done some really interesting work analyzing how developers and repos have been talking about the code of conduct um and after removing some of the noise and machine commits and conversations that were happening um of their sample of 3800 code of conduct conversations they were seeing that 32 percent of them uh conversations were centered around creation um and which is actually quite low still because the contributor covenant has been around for some years now but there's also a significant amount of conversation as well happening around how to moderate these communities how to keep people safe and again engage in its collective action what it means to keep folks engaged safe and ultimately sustainable communities so what i want to charge you all to look at is thinking about what this looks like for the next generation of developers or the next generation of community safety one way this could really or we can think about how we can support and grow folks is by highlighting those who have been doing successful and desirable activities and behavior again we're separating this from the actor from the individual versus their behavior because we want to be able to promote them another perspective as well is think about how are we engaging with human and automated approaches to sanction and discourage undesired behaviors

so that said i want to charge us to think about what we can do today to help support community safety with a quick one-on-one first i want to run through and say that if we can if people care about if communities care about it then it should be measured second if it's important there should be a person accountable for it so not just enough to be about lip service that we're trying to create and foster a great community we want to have human and automated processes that we have a person to point to and can help us mitigate some of those great area situations likewise if there is accountability for this process there should be a reason there's approach to track it so we want to be able to have and be transparent about the process for how people may be sanctioned and how we are promoting uh and encouraging positive behavior on platforms

there is the chaos community which many of you may be familiar with where folks are really looking for developers researchers as well interested in testing out these interventions at a broader scale so i want to charge you all to look at different ways of like psychological safety beyond just reducing harassment or reducing recidivism but thinking about we can challenge safety contributor safety think about how we can grow learners as well in this space

so as i close here i want to leave you all with a few things that you can do today first of all you can make sure your project has a code of conduct if it doesn't you know it's already a sign that's a signal for many contributors you can ask the project maintainers why they don't have one better yet ask them how it is enforced second if your project does not have a code of conduct propose the adopt one the contributor covenant is a great place to start several projects have adopted this and made it make sense for their own so again thinking about you can adopt broader systems and rules to be bespoke for your project and a lot of the research i mentioned before is about the evaluative and iterative process for how these contributors contributed covenants grew third i want to encourage folks to be transparent about the safety procedures in place when you're not you often put contributors at risk and if you want to grow your community and also increase the diversity of contributors you have to be sure you're ready for them um so having procedures in place and then the people will come because in fact when it's it can be more dangerous to promise people safety that you honestly cannot offer them and i also do want to also put on a call here as an fyi that there we are working on some approaches to think about how we can support community safety and sustainability growth at scale so i wanted to make sure you all on the lookout for that as well and with that i'll close and thank you all for your time
