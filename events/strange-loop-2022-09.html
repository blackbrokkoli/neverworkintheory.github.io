---

<p>
  On Friday, September 23,
  It Will Never Work in Theory is offering its second live event
  in conjunction with the <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/">Strange Loop</a> conference.
  Leading software engineering researchers will present short summaries
  of immediate, actionable results from their work:
  FIXME: tags for a few topics
  Our speakers will share what we know about these questions and why we believe it's true.
